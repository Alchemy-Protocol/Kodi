# Kodi
A custom Kodi build that anyone can run to access Federation Content! Every website in the Verse is it's own Channel and streams around the clock. Sites that don't have a lot of content can put their Archives on Loop play, or schedule their own station &amp; premiers. We can put it on open-source Chromecast or Kindle FireStick type devices, and old phones, turning them into a home Media center and Video-on-demand Client device. We can also potentially install Kodi on open-firmware Routers and have just the 'HTML5 Viewer' on smart TVs, so they need 1 less device: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service
